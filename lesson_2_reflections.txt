Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. Git create an hidden directory containing all metadata of my repository.
   To create a repository of the files in the current directory and thus
   enabling version control over them.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
   repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. In staging area you can add files that will be commited.
   Files in working directory and not staged can't be committed (e.g.
   temporary files, personal files...).
   Staging area helps permits you to works on files that for some reason
   don't need to be part of the repository.
   You can also use staging area to commit only some of the files that
   have been changed.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
   logical change?
A. I can add to staging area (and then commit) only the files related to
   the logical change I want to commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
   history organized? How would branches help?
A. Branches are helpful when coding experimental features, fixing bugs,
   adding new features, coding new different version of the program...
   Use the in context switching! Useful to collaborate with others and
   with yourself :)

Q. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A. I can see where new branches started and evenutally had been merged.
   I can also see which branches the commits belong to.

Q. What is the result of merging two branches together?
   Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A. Changes from branch A are merged with changes from branch B.
   The result is a single merged branch. 
   Changes are added or removed in the merged branch comparing A
   and B with the original files. Conflicts may happen!
   We see two lines converging into one.

A. What are the pros and cons of s automatic merging vs. always doing
   merges manually?Git
Q. PROS: faster if no conflicts happen
   CONS: if conflict happens you need to resolve it and maybe it can't be
   	 very simple.
