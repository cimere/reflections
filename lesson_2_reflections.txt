Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. Git create an hidden directory containing all metadata of my repository.
   To create a repository of the files in the current directory and thus
   enabling version control over them.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
   repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. In staging area you can add files that will be commited.
   Files in working directory and not staged can't be committed (e.g.
   temporary files, personal files...).
   Staging area helps permits you to works on files that for some reason
   don't need to be part of the repository.
   You can also use staging area to commit only some of the files that
   have been changed.
