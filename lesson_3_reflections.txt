A. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
   your work local?
Q. When I want to collaborate with others or I want to store the repository
   on another place for redundancy.

A. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
   having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Q. Because I want total control over the repository I'm woking on.

A. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
   When would you use one instead of another?
Q. Branches are different versions of the repository. They're local and can
   be remote.
   Clones are local copy of other remote or local repository. They can also be
   remote.
   Fork are remote clones of remote repository on GitHub. A fork is similar to
   clone a remote repo locally and the push it back on GitHub on a different
   remote repository.
A. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
   remote stored locally?
Q. A local copy permits to work on the code even you're in a forest or when the
   repo is not available. Moreover, if the central server crashes, it's possible
   to restore it pulling the project from a local copy.
